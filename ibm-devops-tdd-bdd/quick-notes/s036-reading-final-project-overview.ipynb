    "In this Final project, you will apply many of the technologies and concepts you've learned in the course and **create a microservice for a product catalog backend to an eCommerce application**. Administrators will use the UI of the eCommerce application to maintain the product catalog.\n",

    "This **Final Project** is divided into two parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **first part of this project**, you will use good Test Driven Development practices to create a REST API that allows users to Create, Read, Update, Delete, and List products by various attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are provided with the starter code – [the GitHub Project Link](https://github.com/ibm-developer-skills-network/xgcyk-tdd-bdd-final-project-template) in which the Create implementation and tests will be provided for you. You need to use this as a template to create your own repository in your GitHub Account.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **acceptance criteria** for **Part 1** would be for all your tests to pass, maintain at least `95%` code coverage, and ensure there are no linting errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **second part of this project**, you will write Behavior Driven Development scenarios to test that the administrative user interface that has been provided for you behaves as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will have to set up the lab environment to use `Python 3.8`, `Selenium`, and `Behave`, just like you did in the BDD Labs.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will create a steps file and load background data from your BDD scenarios into your service before each scenario executes. You will also create a feature file with the BDD scenarios to test and prove that the UI behaves as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from the CRUD functions, you will also search for Products by Category, Availability, and Name.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **acceptance criteria** for **Part 2** would be for all 7 scenarios (one each for Create a Product, Read a Product, Update a Product, Delete a Product, List by Category, List by Available, and List by Name) to exist and pass.\n",
